# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Naval-Vessel-Propulsion-Systems-
This is a project that uses machine learning to predict the degradation of components in a naval gas turbine propulsion system using sensor data. Multiple regression models were tested, and Random Forest gave the best results. The model enables proactive maintenance, improving safety and operational efficiency.
